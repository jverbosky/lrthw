# Learn Ruby the Hard Way
# Exercise 7: More Printing

# Prints the specified string
puts "Mary had a little lamb."

# Prints the specified string and interpolated string
puts "Its fleece was white as #{'snow'}."

# Prints the specified string
puts "And everywhere that Mary went."

# Prints a period ten times
puts "." * 10 # what'd that do?

# Assigns a string to the variable end1
end1 = "C"

# Assigns a string to the variable end2
end2 = "h"

# Assigns a string to the variable end3
end3 = "e"

# Assigns a string to the variable end4
end4 = "e"

# Assigns a string to the variable end5
end5 = "s"

# Assigns a string to the variable end6
end6 = "e"

# Assigns a string to the variable end7
end7 = "B"

# Assigns a string to the variable end8
end8 = "u"

# Assigns a string to the variable end9
end9 = "r"

# Assigns a string to the variable end10
end10 = "g"

# Assigns a string to the variable end11
end11 = "e"

# Assigns a string to the variable end12
end12 = "r"

# watch that print vs. puts on this line what's it do?

# The print statement concatenates the strings assigned to each specified variable,
# without putting a line return at the end
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6

# The puts statement concatenates the strings assigned to each specified variable,
# while putting a line return at the end
puts end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12

# 1) Comments done.
# 2) No errors this time around.
# 3) Will do.
# 4) Good plan.
# 5) Oh yeah - hundreds, if not thousands, every day.  ^_^;
