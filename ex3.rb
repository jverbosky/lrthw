# This line just outputs the string
puts "I will now count my chickens:"

# This line outputs: Hens 30
puts "Hens #{25 + 30 / 6}"
# This line outputs: Rosters 97
puts "Roosters #{100 - 225 * 3 % 4}"

# This line just outputs the string again
puts "Now I will count the eggs:"

# This line outputs: 7
puts 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

# This line yet again outputs the string verbatim
puts "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?"

# This line outputs (evaluates to): false
puts 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

# This line prints the string and evaluates to 5
puts "What is 3 + 2? #{3 + 2}"
# This line prints the string and evaluates to -2
puts "What is 5 - 7? #{5 - 7}"

# This line prints the string verbatim again
puts "Oh, that's why it's false."

# This line prints the string verbatim as well
puts "How about some more."

# This line prints the string and evaluates to: true
puts "Is it greater? #{5 > -2}"
# This line prints the string and also evaluates to: true
puts "is it greater or equal? #{5 >= -2}"
# This line prints the string and evaluates to: false
puts "Is it less or equal? #{5 <= -2}"
